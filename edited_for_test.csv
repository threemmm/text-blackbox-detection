"Marquee in the Cosmopolitan will become the next [UNK] club in Vegas. From the moment I walked into the lobby to being in the night club. I was in awe.\n\nThis club is giant, you have take an elevator up to the 6th floor and up there were 3 levels to the club. The first floor you get off of is the main dance floor where the dj is. Lots of tables and a pretty big dance floor. A long bar and the nicest bathroom ever with lots of sitting room but they don't let you sit for very long. They make you leave after a while.\n\nIf you go downstairs, it's called the Boombox. A smaller dance area with another bar playing different music than the other floor. If you go up one level from the main floor, you're at the library. Definitely just a place for you to chill and rest up, again playing different music from the other floors and has its own bars and some pool tables. From that floor, there's a balcony that you can go on that is above the main dance floor and you could see everything. There's also an outside part to club by the pool? with an outdoor bar and cabana seating. We didn't stay out there very long because it was freezing but I bet it's really nice during the summer.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that there's not that many places to sit on the main floor.

"Marquee in the Cosmopolitan will become the [UNK] big club in Vegas. From the moment I walked into the lobby to being in the night club. I was in awe.\n\nThis club is giant, you have take an elevator up to the 6th floor and up there were 3 levels to the club. The first floor you get off of is the main dance floor where the dj is. Lots of tables and a pretty big dance floor. A long bar and the nicest bathroom ever with lots of sitting room but they don't let you sit for very long. They make you leave after a while.\n\nIf you go downstairs, it's called the Boombox. A smaller dance area with another bar playing different music than the other floor. If you go up one level from the main floor, you're at the library. Definitely just a place for you to chill and rest up, again playing different music from the other floors and has its own bars and some pool tables. From that floor, there's a balcony that you can go on that is above the main dance floor and you could see everything. There's also an outside part to club by the pool? with an outdoor bar and cabana seating. We didn't stay out there very long because it was freezing but I bet it's really nice during the summer.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that there's not that many places to sit on the main floor.

"it 's of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie - six days , seven nights , maybe , or that dreadful sabrina remake . "
corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in . 
"this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars . "
"like mike is a winner for kids , and no doubt a winner for lil bow wow , who can now add movies to the list of things he does well . "
"if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world . "
it all drags on so interminably it 's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time .

affleck and jackson are good sparring partners . 
"but the power of these ( subjects ) is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film 's narrative . "
"challenging , intermittently engrossing and unflaggingly creative . "
the movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure . 
"feature debuter d.j. caruso directs a crack ensemble cast , bringing screenwriter tony gayton 's narcotics noir to life . "
that 's pure pr hype . 
an unclassifiably awful study in self - and audience-abuse . 
"perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie . "
"the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well . "
chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum . 
"well-nigh unendurable ... though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull . "
"for starters , the story is just too slim . "
"it 's also , clearly , great fun . "
moretti 's compelling anatomy of grief and the difficult process of adapting to loss . 
turns potentially forgettable formula into something strangely diverting . 
"while ( hill ) has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film . "
"nothing 's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away -- still , the derivative nine queens is lots of fun . "
"too often , the viewer is n't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance . "
"Taking advice from a local, I bought two dozen sesame bagels to [UNK] up at home.\n\nSO. GLAD. I. DID.\n\nSorry, NY bagel, you do not even compare.

"... plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments . "
old-form moviemaking at its best . 
a sometimes tedious film . 
here 's yet another studio horror franchise mucking up its storyline with glitches casual fans could correct in their sleep . 
the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . 
the overall effect is less like a children 's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts . 
"impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie does n't quite fly . "
"I was not impressed with this place. I called because I wanted a [UNK] minute manicure and it was close by. The woman on the phone quoted me their special price of $25 for a gel manicure. The man doing my nails was nice, but it was weirdly quiet in there. No music or anything. I had a glitter overcoat on my nails and, while I appreciate that he was trying to get a lot of glitter on my nails, it turned out lumpy. He had to fix two nails and there was another lump I didn't bother asking him to fix. And the Polish is off the nail on a few fingers... When I went to pay, he said it was $35, not $25! When I said what I had been quoted he said that was fine. But, even though it said they take card, he asked me to go to the grocery store next door and get cash out. Which required me to buy something. Then they only have multiples of $10, so I paid him $30 (after I had already tipped him) and he didn't offer to give me change. I don't think I will be going to this place again.... I ended up paying as much as I would have at a higher end place anyways."

"this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing . "
zhang ... has done an amazing job of getting realistic performances from his mainly nonprofessional cast . 
more whiny downer than corruscating commentary . 
"it 's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic . "
"his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it . "
"stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad . "
Beware of the kids computer area. I am at this library twice a week [UNK] the kids there are always cussing and acting inappropriate. The first time I heard them I told a lady in the homework room and she told me to go to youth desk and report it. She did nothing. Told them i saw an 11 year old watching straight up porn from youtube. The manager didn't even go through the history and said it was an accident and he couldn't remember what he clicked on. She told him that they needed to know so they could block it. That's it! This kid intended to watch it and maximized it for a whole 3 minutes. My 7 year old daughter just got an eye full and I am not happy with management's reaction.

when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie . 
ahhhh ... revenge is sweet ! 
"displaying about equal amounts of naiveté , passion and talent , beneath clouds establishes sen as a filmmaker of considerable potential . "
"does paint some memorable images ... , but makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters "
the socio-histo-political treatise is told in earnest strides ... ( and ) personal illusion is deconstructed with poignancy . 
a quiet treasure -- a film to be savored . 
zaidan 's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight . 
( d ) oes n't bother being as cloying or preachy as equivalent evangelical christian movies -- maybe the filmmakers know that the likely audience will already be among the faithful . 
"by candidly detailing the politics involved in the creation of an extraordinary piece of music , ( jones ) calls our attention to the inherent conflict between commerce and creativity . "
you do n't have to know about music to appreciate the film 's easygoing blend of comedy and romance . 
"this is a good script , good dialogue , funny even for adults . "
bogdanovich tantalizes by offering a peep show into the lives of the era 's creme de la celluloid . 
"it 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface . "
"corny , schmaltzy and predictable , but still manages to be kind of heartwarming , nonetheless . "
"majidi is an unconventional storyteller , capable of finding beauty in the most depressing places . "
"This is by far the worst Golden Corral I have ever been to-- and I've [UNK] to a lot. For $12.99 for dinner, I'd expect the buffet bars to be fully stocked and then replenished on a regular basis. I'd also expect staff to clean the bars regularly, especially of stray food that lands in another dish. Neither of these occurred.  The restaurant appeared sorely short-staffed, and those who do work here didn't appear particularly enthused about their work. Between the constant announcements of \""""Code 200\"""" and \""""Your children will be burned by the 165-degree bar if unaccompanied,\"""" it was an unbearable atmosphere. Go to a nice sit-down restaurant instead where you will certainly get a better value and atmosphere."

one of the smartest takes on singles culture i 've seen in a long time . 
"the movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate/surf culture , the l.a. beach scene and the imaginative ( and sometimes illegal ) ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults . "
cq 's reflection of artists and the love of cinema-and-self suggests nothing less than a new voice that deserves to be considered as a possible successor to the best european directors .

My son had his 3 year birthday party here last weekend. We paid a lot of [UNK] to get the basic party and we were really disappointed. The staff girls are so nice I didn't have the heart to say anything. When we arrived for the party they said they couldn't get a hold of us so they weren't sure if we were coming. I almost fell on the floor thinking we didn't have the space. We did everything from food to cake to party gifts. There were no toys. There was a cool kid gym to play but I expected more toys like kinder land or tykes n tots. It felt very rushed. The party was 3-430. They had all the kids come in at 4 to do cake then told us gym is closed  the kids had to stay n this room until 430. Everybody had fun in the end but I wanted to complain to management that for 350 dollars we got nothing!  A few balloons they provided and a few chairs set out for 20 to 30 people. The only star is for how nice the young girls were that helped with the party itself. I would never recommend kid ville to anyone. Save your money and book early at kinder land or tykes n tots or anyplace else.

Everybody had fun in the end but I wanted to complain to management that for 350 dollars we got nothing!  A few balloons they provided and a few chairs set out for 20 to 30 people. The only star is for how nice the young girls were that helped with the party itself. I would never recommend kid ville to anyone. Save your money and book early at kinder land or tykes n tots or anyplace else.
My son had his 3 year birthday party here [UNK] weekend. We paid a lot of money to get the basic party and we were really disappointed. The staff girls are so nice I didn't have the heart to say anything. When we arrived for the party they said they couldn't get a hold of us so they weren't sure if we were coming. I almost fell on the floor thinking we didn't have the space. We did everything from food to cake to party gifts. There were no toys.

"We went to Pastis on the recommendation of some friends.  Our good friends went with us on [UNK] Saturday night.  This place was great.  I'd describe it like others: part bistro, part cafe, part casual restaurant.  It also has take-out and a market if you are longing for your European favorite chocolates, sauces, canned meats :-).\n\nWe sat in the restaurant area.  VERY casual and I loved that.  We were greeted very kindly by one of the owners' wife.  The menu has plenty of options.  Our server (who actually was one of the owners as well) told us about the special (Chicken Cordon Bleu) and spoke with such perfection in his accents on Spanish and French words that we had to ask where he was from.  \n\nOne of the owners, Luka (sorry if I misspelled it), was born in Serbia, but grew up in the French Riviera.  His father was a professional soccer player so they traveled a lot.  Luka himself was also a professional soccer player and that is what brought him to Arizona (on a scholarship).  He loved it so much and decided to stay.  VERY humble and nice guy and it is great that the owners have such a stake in the business at these early stages.\n\nTwo in our party opted for the Cordon Bleu special, which was fantastic!  I ordered the Athena sandwich (pastrami) and my friend ordered the Madrid sandwich (prosciutto and turkey and brie).  All of these were the first recommendations from Luka, whithout hesitation.  THEY WERE GREAT!  There were so many things on the menu and I wanted to try them all...so I'll definitely be back.\n\nThe portions were perfect, and the sandwich portion was generous.  We heard about the crepes as well and opted to order (2 per order, yum!).  We got Nutella/Banana and Nutella/Toasted Coconut/Crushed biscuit.  Holy crap they were good -- do the crushed biscuit...it really adds something great!\n\nOverall, this place was fantastic!  If there was a 4.5 star rating I'd have to give it that.  Luka was very kind, explained everything and shared some personal history of his journey to this point.  Great atmosphere.  He also explained the name of the restaurant to us, so you'll have to ask *when* you go (not if, but when).\n\nThis is a great place and we WILL be back!  We saw they have a \""""breakfast in Paris\"""" menu on Sat/Sunday morning so we'll have to try that some time.\n\nIt is places like Pastis that I hope truly survive more than the conglomorates.  Passion is evident here at Pastis.\n\nUPDATE May 2009:  Went back and the fact that the owners remembered us was awesome -- up one more star for local goodness.  And live music on Saturday nights now!!"

"not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved , and daniel radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as harry , but the film conjures the magic of author j.k. rowling 's books . "
no telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie . 
"offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm . "
sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest . 
"in a way , the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that allow it in . "
"it 's as if you 're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker . "
it 's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one . 
"neither parker nor donovan is a typical romantic lead , but they bring a fresh , quirky charm to the formula . "
"try as i may , i ca n't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , ` thank you ! ' "
"writer/director joe carnahan 's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches , but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic . "

"liotta put on 30 pounds for the role , and has completely transformed himself from his smooth , goodfellas image . "
the film 's tone and pacing are off almost from the get-go . 
"( næs ) directed the stage version of elling , and gets fine performances from his two leads who originated the characters on stage . "
"determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor did n't quite engage this adult . "
a romantic comedy enriched by a sharp eye for manners and mores . 
"less dizzying than just dizzy , the jaunt is practically over before it begins . "
nervous breakdowns are not entertaining . 
"the movie is what happens when you blow up small potatoes to 10 times their natural size , and it ai n't pretty . "
the emotions are raw and will strike a nerve with anyone who 's ever had family trauma . 
"If it's your first visit, here's a bit of advice:  in the vestibule, before you enter the store, take a number. This is the same procedure whether you are just there for a loaf of bread or are going to stay and have coffee and a croissant. Knowing your numbers from 1-99 in French will help you get served. If not, look up at the [UNK] glowy number behind the counter to the left.\n\nKind of an eclectic atmosphere in the seating upstairs. Bonus points for having a coffee-doctoring station (milk, cream, sugar, napkins, ...) upstairs so that you don't have to run back downstairs with your cup of tea or java.\n\nDefinitely very good pastries. For my money, Olive & Gourmando or Premi\u00e8re Moisson are better, but these are very good. Coffee, meh."

"the movie is n't just hilarious : it 's witty and inventive , too , and in hindsight , it is n't even all that dumb . "
it 's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth . 
but it 's too long and too convoluted and it ends in a muddle . 
"this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic . "
"instead , he shows them the respect they are due . "
big fat waste of time . 
"crackerjack entertainment -- nonstop romance , music , suspense and action . "
"shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere . "
"a lean , deftly shot , well-acted , weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s european-set spy pictures . "
"a smart , witty follow-up . "
i got a headache watching this meaningless downer . 
"uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions . "
"for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it 's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking . "
a solid examination of the male midlife crisis . 
brilliantly explores the conflict between following one 's heart and following the demands of tradition . 
like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything 's in place but something 's just a little off-kilter . 
it 's an offbeat treat that pokes fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part . 
"i do n't mind having my heartstrings pulled , but do n't treat me like a fool . "
do not see this film . 
"there is nothing outstanding about this film , but it is good enough and will likely be appreciated most by sailors and folks who know their way around a submarine . "
too much of it feels unfocused and underdeveloped . 
it 's a work by an artist so in control of both his medium and his message that he can improvise like a jazzman . 
"a big , gorgeous , sprawling swashbuckler that delivers its diversions in grand , uncomplicated fashion . "
` de niro ... is a veritable source of sincere passion that this hollywood contrivance orbits around . ' 
"all that 's missing is the spontaneity , originality and delight . "
my reaction in a word : disappointment . 
an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes . 
"warm water under a red bridge is a quirky and poignant japanese film that explores the fascinating connections between women , water , nature , and sexuality . "
"it 's somewhat clumsy and too lethargically paced -- but its story about a mysterious creature with psychic abilities offers a solid build-up , a terrific climax , and some nice chills along the way . "
"even on those rare occasions when the narrator stops yammering , miller 's hand often feels unsure . "
i thought my own watch had stopped keeping time as i slogged my way through clockstoppers . 
"highbrow self-appointed guardians of culture need not apply , but those who loved cool as ice have at last found a worthy follow-up . "
"a moody , multi-dimensional love story and sci-fi mystery , solaris is a thought-provoking , haunting film that allows the seeds of the imagination to germinate . "
the film 's welcome breeziness and some unbelievably hilarious moments -- most portraying the idiocy of the film industry -- make it mostly worth the trip .
