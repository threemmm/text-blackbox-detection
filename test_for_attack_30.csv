"Marquee in the Cosmopolitan will become the next [UNK] club in Vegas. From the moment I walked into the lobby to being in the night club. I was in awe.\n\nThis club is giant, you have take an elevator up to the 6th floor and up there were 3 levels to the club. The first floor you get off of is the main dance floor where the dj is. Lots of tables and a pretty big dance floor. A long bar and the nicest bathroom ever with lots of sitting room but they don't let you sit for very long. They make you leave after a while.\n\nIf you go downstairs, it's called the Boombox. A smaller dance area with another bar playing different music than the other floor. If you go up one level from the main floor, you're at the library. Definitely just a place for you to chill and rest up, again playing different music from the other floors and has its own bars and some pool tables. From that floor, there's a balcony that you can go on that is above the main dance floor and you could see everything. There's also an outside part to club by the pool? with an outdoor bar and cabana seating. We didn't stay out there very long because it was freezing but I bet it's really nice during the summer.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that there's not that many places to sit on the main floor.

"Marquee in the Cosmopolitan will become the [UNK] big club in Vegas. From the moment I walked into the lobby to being in the night club. I was in awe.\n\nThis club is giant, you have take an elevator up to the 6th floor and up there were 3 levels to the club. The first floor you get off of is the main dance floor where the dj is. Lots of tables and a pretty big dance floor. A long bar and the nicest bathroom ever with lots of sitting room but they don't let you sit for very long. They make you leave after a while.\n\nIf you go downstairs, it's called the Boombox. A smaller dance area with another bar playing different music than the other floor. If you go up one level from the main floor, you're at the library. Definitely just a place for you to chill and rest up, again playing different music from the other floors and has its own bars and some pool tables. From that floor, there's a balcony that you can go on that is above the main dance floor and you could see everything. There's also an outside part to club by the pool? with an outdoor bar and cabana seating. We didn't stay out there very long because it was freezing but I bet it's really nice during the summer.\n\nThe only reason I'm giving it 4 stars is that there's not that many places to sit on the main floor.

"it 's of the quality of a lesser harrison ford movie - six days , seven nights , maybe , or that dreadful sabrina remake . "
corpus collosum -- while undeniably interesting -- wore out its welcome well before the end credits rolled about 45 minutes in . 
"this is a shameless sham , calculated to cash in on the popularity of its stars . "
"like mike is a winner for kids , and no doubt a winner for lil bow wow , who can now add movies to the list of things he does well . "
"if the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of ` there but for the grace of god , ' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world . "
it all drags on so interminably it 's like watching a miserable relationship unfold in real time .

affleck and jackson are good sparring partners . 
"but the power of these ( subjects ) is obscured by the majority of the film that shows a stationary camera on a subject that could be mistaken for giving a public oration , rather than contributing to a film 's narrative . "
"challenging , intermittently engrossing and unflaggingly creative . "
the movie understands like few others how the depth and breadth of emotional intimacy give the physical act all of its meaning and most of its pleasure . 
"feature debuter d.j. caruso directs a crack ensemble cast , bringing screenwriter tony gayton 's narcotics noir to life . "
that 's pure pr hype . 
an unclassifiably awful study in self - and audience-abuse . 
"perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie . "
"the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well . "
chokes on its own depiction of upper-crust decorum . 
"well-nigh unendurable ... though the picture strains to become cinematic poetry , it remains depressingly prosaic and dull . "
"for starters , the story is just too slim . "
"it 's also , clearly , great fun . "
moretti 's compelling anatomy of grief and the difficult process of adapting to loss . 
turns potentially forgettable formula into something strangely diverting . 
"while ( hill ) has learned new tricks , the tricks alone are not enough to salvage this lifeless boxing film . "
"nothing 's at stake , just a twisty double-cross you can smell a mile away -- still , the derivative nine queens is lots of fun . "
"too often , the viewer is n't reacting to humor so much as they are wincing back in repugnance . "
"Taking advice from a local, I bought two dozen sesame bagels to [UNK] up at home.\n\nSO. GLAD. I. DID.\n\nSorry, NY bagel, you do not even compare.

"... plot holes so large and obvious a marching band might as well be stomping through them in clown clothes , playing a college football fight song on untuned instruments . "
old-form moviemaking at its best . 
a sometimes tedious film . 
here 's yet another studio horror franchise mucking up its storyline with glitches casual fans could correct in their sleep . 
the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . 
the overall effect is less like a children 's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts . 
"impostor has a handful of thrilling moments and a couple of good performances , but the movie does n't quite fly . "
"I was not impressed with this place. I called because I wanted a [UNK] minute manicure and it was close by. The woman on the phone quoted me their special price of $25 for a gel manicure. The man doing my nails was nice, but it was weirdly quiet in there. No music or anything. I had a glitter overcoat on my nails and, while I appreciate that he was trying to get a lot of glitter on my nails, it turned out lumpy. He had to fix two nails and there was another lump I didn't bother asking him to fix. And the Polish is off the nail on a few fingers... When I went to pay, he said it was $35, not $25! When I said what I had been quoted he said that was fine. But, even though it said they take card, he asked me to go to the grocery store next door and get cash out. Which required me to buy something. Then they only have multiples of $10, so I paid him $30 (after I had already tipped him) and he didn't offer to give me change. I don't think I will be going to this place again.... I ended up paying as much as I would have at a higher end place anyways."

"this is the sort of burly action flick where one coincidence pummels another , narrative necessity is a drunken roundhouse , and whatever passes for logic is a factor of the last plot device left standing . "
zhang ... has done an amazing job of getting realistic performances from his mainly nonprofessional cast . 
more whiny downer than corruscating commentary . 
"it 's too self-important and plodding to be funny , and too clipped and abbreviated to be an epic . "
"his last movie was poetically romantic and full of indelible images , but his latest has nothing going for it . "
"stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad . "
Beware of the kids computer area. I am at this library twice a week [UNK] the kids there are always cussing and acting inappropriate. The first time I heard them I told a lady in the homework room and she told me to go to youth desk and report it. She did nothing. Told them i saw an 11 year old watching straight up porn from youtube. The manager didn't even go through the history and said it was an accident and he couldn't remember what he clicked on. She told him that they needed to know so they could block it. That's it! This kid intended to watch it and maximized it for a whole 3 minutes. My 7 year old daughter just got an eye full and I am not happy with management's reaction.

when leguizamo finally plugged an irritating character late in the movie . 
ahhhh ... revenge is sweet ! 
"displaying about equal amounts of naiveté , passion and talent , beneath clouds establishes sen as a filmmaker of considerable potential . "
"does paint some memorable images ... , but makhmalbaf keeps her distance from the characters "
the socio-histo-political treatise is told in earnest strides ... ( and ) personal illusion is deconstructed with poignancy . 
a quiet treasure -- a film to be savored . 
zaidan 's script has barely enough plot to string the stunts together and not quite enough characterization to keep the faces straight . 
( d ) oes n't bother being as cloying or preachy as equivalent evangelical christian movies -- maybe the filmmakers know that the likely audience will already be among the faithful . 
"by candidly detailing the politics involved in the creation of an extraordinary piece of music , ( jones ) calls our attention to the inherent conflict between commerce and creativity . "
you do n't have to know about music to appreciate the film 's easygoing blend of comedy and romance . 
"this is a good script , good dialogue , funny even for adults . "
bogdanovich tantalizes by offering a peep show into the lives of the era 's creme de la celluloid . 
"it 's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface . "
"corny , schmaltzy and predictable , but still manages to be kind of heartwarming , nonetheless . "
"majidi is an unconventional storyteller , capable of finding beauty in the most depressing places . "
"This is by far the worst Golden Corral I have ever been to-- and I've [UNK] to a lot. For $12.99 for dinner, I'd expect the buffet bars to be fully stocked and then replenished on a regular basis. I'd also expect staff to clean the bars regularly, especially of stray food that lands in another dish. Neither of these occurred.  The restaurant appeared sorely short-staffed, and those who do work here didn't appear particularly enthused about their work. Between the constant announcements of \""""Code 200\"""" and \""""Your children will be burned by the 165-degree bar if unaccompanied,\"""" it was an unbearable atmosphere. Go to a nice sit-down restaurant instead where you will certainly get a better value and atmosphere."

one of the smartest takes on singles culture i 've seen in a long time . 
"the movie has an infectious exuberance that will engage anyone with a passing interest in the skate/surf culture , the l.a. beach scene and the imaginative ( and sometimes illegal ) ways kids can make a playground out of the refuse of adults . "
cq 's reflection of artists and the love of cinema-and-self suggests nothing less than a new voice that deserves to be considered as a possible successor to the best european directors .

My son had his 3 year birthday party here last weekend. We paid a lot of [UNK] to get the basic party and we were really disappointed. The staff girls are so nice I didn't have the heart to say anything. When we arrived for the party they said they couldn't get a hold of us so they weren't sure if we were coming. I almost fell on the floor thinking we didn't have the space. We did everything from food to cake to party gifts. There were no toys. There was a cool kid gym to play but I expected more toys like kinder land or tykes n tots. It felt very rushed. The party was 3-430. They had all the kids come in at 4 to do cake then told us gym is closed  the kids had to stay n this room until 430. Everybody had fun in the end but I wanted to complain to management that for 350 dollars we got nothing!  A few balloons they provided and a few chairs set out for 20 to 30 people. The only star is for how nice the young girls were that helped with the party itself. I would never recommend kid ville to anyone. Save your money and book early at kinder land or tykes n tots or anyplace else.

Everybody had fun in the end but I wanted to complain to management that for 350 dollars we got nothing!  A few balloons they provided and a few chairs set out for 20 to 30 people. The only star is for how nice the young girls were that helped with the party itself. I would never recommend kid ville to anyone. Save your money and book early at kinder land or tykes n tots or anyplace else.
My son had his 3 year birthday party here [UNK] weekend. We paid a lot of money to get the basic party and we were really disappointed. The staff girls are so nice I didn't have the heart to say anything. When we arrived for the party they said they couldn't get a hold of us so they weren't sure if we were coming. I almost fell on the floor thinking we didn't have the space. We did everything from food to cake to party gifts. There were no toys.

"We went to Pastis on the recommendation of some friends.  Our good friends went with us on [UNK] Saturday night.  This place was great.  I'd describe it like others: part bistro, part cafe, part casual restaurant.  It also has take-out and a market if you are longing for your European favorite chocolates, sauces, canned meats :-).\n\nWe sat in the restaurant area.  VERY casual and I loved that.  We were greeted very kindly by one of the owners' wife.  The menu has plenty of options.  Our server (who actually was one of the owners as well) told us about the special (Chicken Cordon Bleu) and spoke with such perfection in his accents on Spanish and French words that we had to ask where he was from.  \n\nOne of the owners, Luka (sorry if I misspelled it), was born in Serbia, but grew up in the French Riviera.  His father was a professional soccer player so they traveled a lot.  Luka himself was also a professional soccer player and that is what brought him to Arizona (on a scholarship).  He loved it so much and decided to stay.  VERY humble and nice guy and it is great that the owners have such a stake in the business at these early stages.\n\nTwo in our party opted for the Cordon Bleu special, which was fantastic!  I ordered the Athena sandwich (pastrami) and my friend ordered the Madrid sandwich (prosciutto and turkey and brie).  All of these were the first recommendations from Luka, whithout hesitation.  THEY WERE GREAT!  There were so many things on the menu and I wanted to try them all...so I'll definitely be back.\n\nThe portions were perfect, and the sandwich portion was generous.  We heard about the crepes as well and opted to order (2 per order, yum!).  We got Nutella/Banana and Nutella/Toasted Coconut/Crushed biscuit.  Holy crap they were good -- do the crushed biscuit...it really adds something great!\n\nOverall, this place was fantastic!  If there was a 4.5 star rating I'd have to give it that.  Luka was very kind, explained everything and shared some personal history of his journey to this point.  Great atmosphere.  He also explained the name of the restaurant to us, so you'll have to ask *when* you go (not if, but when).\n\nThis is a great place and we WILL be back!  We saw they have a \""""breakfast in Paris\"""" menu on Sat/Sunday morning so we'll have to try that some time.\n\nIt is places like Pastis that I hope truly survive more than the conglomorates.  Passion is evident here at Pastis.\n\nUPDATE May 2009:  Went back and the fact that the owners remembered us was awesome -- up one more star for local goodness.  And live music on Saturday nights now!!"

"not only are the special effects and narrative flow much improved , and daniel radcliffe more emotionally assertive this time around as harry , but the film conjures the magic of author j.k. rowling 's books . "
no telegraphing is too obvious or simplistic for this movie . 
"offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs ... a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm . "
sometimes seems less like storytelling than something the otherwise compelling director needed to get off his chest . 
"in a way , the film feels like a breath of fresh air , but only to those that allow it in . "
"it 's as if you 're watching a movie that was made in 1978 but not released then because it was so weak , and it has been unearthed and released now , when it has become even weaker . "
it 's too bad that the helping hand he uses to stir his ingredients is also a heavy one . 
"neither parker nor donovan is a typical romantic lead , but they bring a fresh , quirky charm to the formula . "
"try as i may , i ca n't think of a single good reason to see this movie , even though everyone in my group extemporaneously shouted , ` thank you ! ' "
"writer/director joe carnahan 's grimy crime drama is a manual of precinct cliches , but it moves fast enough to cover its clunky dialogue and lapses in logic . "

a romantic comedy enriched by a sharp eye for manners and mores .

nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .

"If it's your first visit, here's a bit of advice:  in the vestibule, before you enter the store, take a number. This is the same procedure whether you are just there for a loaf of bread or are going to stay and have coffee and a croissant. Knowing your numbers from 1-99 in French will help you get served. If not, look up at the [UNK] glowy number behind the counter to the left.\n\nKind of an eclectic atmosphere in the seating upstairs. Bonus points for having a coffee-doctoring station (milk, cream, sugar, napkins, ...) upstairs so that you don't have to run back downstairs with your cup of tea or java.\n\nDefinitely very good pastries. For my money, Olive & Gourmando or Premi\u00e8re Moisson are better, but these are very good. Coffee, meh."

"the movie is n't just hilarious : it 's witty and inventive , too , and in hindsight , it is n't even all that dumb . "
it 's a stunning lyrical work of considerable force and truth . 
but it 's too long and too convoluted and it ends in a muddle . 
"this is an egotistical endeavor from the daughter of horror director dario argento ( a producer here ) , but her raw performance and utter fearlessness make it strangely magnetic . "
"instead , he shows them the respect they are due . "
big fat waste of time . 
"crackerjack entertainment -- nonstop romance , music , suspense and action . "
"shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere . "
"The experience I had here could be summed up in one word: long. I was with a group of 9, and after a day of playing in the snow, we got really hungry. \n\nWe were first told that the wait was gonna be 25-30 minutes long, which we were okay with and then once seated, it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to get our drinks. Then another 10 minutes to actually get them. We had a look at the menu and everything was pretty overpriced, especially for a bunch of college kids. Once our orders were placed, it took about [UNK] minutes to get our food. I would've given it 1 star but the food was actually pretty good, but not $18 for a burger good. After eating, it took about 30 minutes for us to get our checks, then another 15 minutes to get our cards back. By that point, we were there for almost 2 hours. Not a pleasant experience, I will lost likely not be returning again."

I was with a group of 9, and after a day of playing in the snow, we got really hungry. \n\nWe were first told that the wait was gonna be 25-30 minutes long, which we were okay with and then once seated, it took about 10 minutes for the waitress to get our drinks. Then another 10 minutes to actually get them. We had a look at the menu and everything was pretty overpriced, especially for a bunch of college kids. Once our orders were placed, [UNK] took about 50 minutes to get our food. I would've given it 1 star but the food was actually pretty good, but not $18 for a burger good. After eating, it took about 30 minutes for us to get our checks, then another 15 minutes to get our cards back. By that point, we were there for almost 2 hours.

"a lean , deftly shot , well-acted , weirdly retro thriller that recalls a raft of '60s and '70s european-set spy pictures . "
"a smart , witty follow-up . "
i got a headache watching this meaningless downer . 
"uncommonly stylish but equally silly ... the picture fails to generate much suspense , nor does it ask searching enough questions to justify its pretensions . "
"for all its technical virtuosity , the film is so mired in juvenile and near-xenophobic pedagogy that it 's enough to make one pine for the day when godard can no longer handle the rigors of filmmaking . "
a solid examination of the male midlife crisis . 
brilliantly explores the conflict between following one 's heart and following the demands of tradition . 
"I agree with PS, way overrated.  And you'd think after all the years and the money this place makes it would refurbish the booth seats--they seem like the same since the 80's!  Salsa flavor was off, something missing like an herb, epazote?, and the chips, maybe its the GMO corn used to produce them, they just don't taste real.  The margarita was so acidic that by the second sip I couldn't drink [UNK].  Service is also very complacent.  Cute little chile tepin bush in the planter next to the front door."

like watching a dress rehearsal the week before the show goes up : everything 's in place but something 's just a little off-kilter . 
it 's an offbeat treat that pokes fun at the democratic exercise while also examining its significance for those who take part .

my reaction in a word : disappointment . 
"So, it's New Year's Eve.  It's been one heck of a year, and I'm glad it's almost over.  I wake up, ready to start my day and go get my hair done, grab lunch with my girlfriend and then party the night away.  And then I discover the pool that is my garage.\nApparently, my water heater decided to die sometime in the middle of the night and drain the contents of it's body all over the floor.  RIP Heaty.  [UNK] nine in the morning on new year's eve, and I'm panic stricken, trying to find a plumber to come out and either fix or replace it.  Thank gosh for Yelp and Water Heater Pros.\n\nI gave them a call and left a voicemail, and promptly got called back within ten or so minutes.  They asked me basic questions about my unit, assessed that it needed to be replaced and quoted me a price.  A great price in my opinion, given that the first company I had talked to wanted $300 more for the exact same thing.  He gave me a time of between 11:30-12:30, which was even better.  Same day service on a (almost) holiday?  Then to top it off, there was a knock at my door about 15 minutes before the time window - yay!  Not just on time, but early.\n\nI got to have Charlie work on my heater.  He confirmed it needed replacing, and after we talked briefly about the heater and what all needed to be done, I let him alone to work in peace.  Within about ninety minutes, he was all wrapped up and I still have time to make my hair appointment today.  \n\nI am amazingly pleased all around.  With Charlie's nice demeanor, his service, showing up early, and the pricing.  I'll definitely recommend Water Heating Pros to any friends that might get in a similar situation in the future."

A great price in my opinion, given that the first company I had talked to wanted $300 more for the exact same thing.  He gave me a time of between 11:30-12:30, which was even better.  Same day service on a (almost) holiday?  Then to top it off, there was a knock at my door about 15 minutes before the time window - yay!  Not just on time, but early.\n\nI got to have Charlie work on my heater.  He confirmed it needed replacing, and after we talked briefly about the heater and what all needed to be done, I let him alone to work in peace.  Within about ninety minutes, he was all wrapped up and I still have time to make my hair appointment today.  \n\nI am amazingly pleased all around.  With Charlie's nice demeanor, his service, showing up early, and the pricing.  I'll definitely recommend Water Heating Pros to any friends that might get in a similar situation in the future."

They asked me basic questions about my unit, assessed that it needed to be replaced and quoted me a price.  A great price in my opinion, given that the first company I had talked to wanted $300 more for the exact same thing.  He gave me a time of between 11:30-12:30, which was even better.  Same day service on a (almost) holiday?  Then to top it off, there was a knock at my door about 15 minutes before the time window - yay!  Not just on time, but early.\n\nI got to have Charlie work on my heater.  He confirmed it needed replacing, and after we talked briefly about the heater and what all needed to be done, I let him alone to work in peace.  Within about ninety minutes, he was all wrapped up and I still have time to make my hair appointment today.  \n\nI am amazingly pleased all around.  With Charlie's nice demeanor, his service, showing up early, and the pricing.  I'll definitely recommend Water Heating Pros to any friends that might get in a similar situation in the future."
"So, it's New Year's Eve.  It's been one heck of a year, and I'm glad it's almost over.  I wake up, ready to start my day and go get my hair done, grab lunch with my girlfriend and then party the night away.

"I'm obsessed with the breakfast here. There's a huge smorgasbord of options to choose from on the brekkie menu, and the hardest part is actually picking something to order because they all sound so good!\n\nI couldn't resist ordering the eggs benedicto. What a cute twist on your typical eggs benedict dish! The eggs were perfectly poached on toasty slabs of english muffin and accented with the rich and savory sundried tomato hollandaise. The bits of candied prosciutto added a nice meatiness to the benedict without making it too heavy. And while I don't normally reach for mixed greens for breakfast.... I did like it in this dish because my usual gripe with eggs benedict is that there's just wayyy too much going on. [UNK] the greens were a light alternative that kinda balanced everything out in a way that potatoes don't do it for me.\n\nI also picked up the horchata latte. I'm a huge fan of horchata (which is pretty hard to find in Hawaii where I'm from) and a coffee lover, so this was a must try for me! It's totally sweet, creamy, and probably chock full of calories, but worth every single tasty sip. \n\nIf you're not feeling in a benedicto mood, that's OK because there's a ton of other food options to choose from. All of which resemble your standard breakfast fare, with a little bit of a twist. Mexican, southern, classic american breakfasts... You name it. If I had more stomach room and a little more time in Madison, I'd wanna try a little bit of every dish on the menu. One of each, please!"

"may be far from the best of the series , but it 's assured , wonderfully respectful of its past and thrilling enough to make it abundantly clear that this movie phenomenon has once again reinvented itself for a new generation . "
"no sophomore slump for director sam mendes , who segues from oscar winner to oscar-winning potential with a smooth sleight of hand . "
"a very well-made , funny and entertaining picture . "
if you dig on david mamet 's mind tricks ... rent this movie and enjoy ! 
it 's a charming and often affecting journey . 
it made me want to wrench my eyes out of my head and toss them at the screen . 
"delivers the same old same old , tarted up with latin flava and turned out by hollywood playas . "
"at its best , queen is campy fun like the vincent price horror classics of the '60s . "
"the movie is dawn of the dead crossed with john carpenter 's ghosts of mars , with zombies not as ghoulish as the first and trains not as big as the second . "
"even with a green mohawk and a sheet of fire-red flame tattoos covering his shoulder , however , kilmer seems to be posing , rather than acting . "
"the lion king was a roaring success when it was released eight years ago , but on imax it seems better , not just bigger . "
"I was in Las Vegas for a bachelorette party last weekend. We were excited for our first night out and a fancy dinner. Our salads were delicious and that's [UNK] the good stops. I decided to splurge and order the ribeye which is $50 a la carte and goes against my whole being because that is a ridiculous price. I thought \""""hey why not it's vegas?\"""" I ordered my steak rare....it was overcooked and not seasoned well at all. I ordered a side of the fingerling potatoes with rosemary. I got little baby potatoes with a couple sprigs of rosemary on top. It was like one of those horrible dishes your grandmother throws together to make dinner seem fancy. It was very hard to hand over my portion of the bill when at home I can go down the street and order a 16oz Ribeye that comes with a baked potato and side salad for $9.95 (and it's the best damn steak I've ever had); I actually went there when I flew in to cheer up. \n\nOut of 5 of us only one liked their dinner; which happened to be the bachelorette so we were happy. Another one of us ordered the beef tartar and it came with something like bagel chips instead of a sliced baguette. When she asked the server if they had a sliced baguette she looked at her like she was insane; left for maybe a minute and then came back saying \""""they just couldn't do it\"""".  VERY RUDE! \n\nWe ended up taking our leftovers hoping we would see a homeless person to give them to. \n\nWe also thought it was ironic that the owner of this restaurant is so judgemental on his show, yet this was a terrible dinner."

I thought \""""hey why not it's vegas?\"""" I ordered my steak rare....it was overcooked and not seasoned well at all. I ordered a side of the fingerling potatoes with rosemary. I got little baby potatoes with a couple sprigs of rosemary on top. It was like one of those horrible dishes your grandmother throws together to make dinner seem fancy. It was very hard to hand over my portion of the bill when at home I can go down the street and order a 16oz Ribeye that comes with a baked potato and side salad for $9.95 (and it's the best damn steak I've ever had); I actually went there when I flew in to cheer up. \n\nOut of 5 of us only one liked their dinner; which happened to be the bachelorette so we were happy. Another one of us ordered the beef tartar and it came with something like bagel chips instead of a sliced baguette. When she asked the server if they had a sliced baguette she looked at her like she was insane; left for maybe a minute and then came back saying \""""they just couldn't do it\"""".  VERY RUDE! \n\nWe ended up taking our leftovers hoping we would see a homeless person to give them to. \n\nWe also thought it was ironic that the owner of this restaurant is so judgemental on his show, yet this was a terrible dinner."

( a ) n utterly charming and hilarious film that reminded me of the best of the disney comedies from the 60s . 
"there 's too much falseness to the second half , and what began as an intriguing look at youth fizzles into a dull , ridiculous attempt at heart-tugging . "
"featuring a dangerously seductive performance from the great daniel auteuil , `` sade '' covers the same period as kaufmann 's `` quills '' with more unsettlingly realistic results . "
at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch . 
"a fast , funny , highly enjoyable movie . "
"despite the evocative aesthetics evincing the hollow state of modern love life , the film never percolates beyond a monotonous whine . "
"it 's a cookie-cutter movie , a cut-and-paste job . "
there 's not enough here to justify the almost two hours . 
it 's great escapist fun that recreates a place and time that will never happen again . 
"as surreal as a dream and as detailed as a photograph , as visually dexterous as it is at times imaginatively overwhelming . "
"it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes . "
"is the time really ripe for a warmed-over james bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ? "
overall very good for what it 's trying to do . 
"even the finest chef ca n't make a hotdog into anything more than a hotdog , and robert de niro ca n't make this movie anything more than a trashy cop buddy comedy . "
a movie that reminds us of just how exciting and satisfying the fantasy cinema can be when it 's approached with imagination and flair . 
"ramsay , as in ratcatcher , remains a filmmaker with an acid viewpoint and a real gift for teasing chilly poetry out of lives and settings that might otherwise seem drab and sordid . "
"this time mr. burns is trying something in the martin scorsese street-realist mode , but his self-regarding sentimentality trips him up again . "
"while the ideas about techno-saturation are far from novel , they 're presented with a wry dark humor . "
my thoughts were focused on the characters . 
no one but a convict guilty of some truly heinous crime should have to sit through the master of disguise . 
"it can not be enjoyed , even on the level that one enjoys a bad slasher flick , primarily because it is dull . "
` easily my choice for one of the year 's best films . ' 
"kinnear does n't aim for our sympathy , but rather delivers a performance of striking skill and depth . "
no way i can believe this load of junk . 
"... routine , harmless diversion and little else . "
a by-the-numbers effort that wo n't do much to enhance the franchise . 
collateral damage finally delivers the goods for schwarzenegger fans . 
the characters are interesting and often very creatively constructed from figure to backstory . 
confirms the nagging suspicion that ethan hawke would be even worse behind the camera than he is in front of it . 
"it 's about following your dreams , no matter what your parents think . "
"miller is playing so free with emotions , and the fact that children are hostages to fortune , that he makes the audience hostage to his swaggering affectation of seriousness . "
to call the other side of heaven `` appalling '' would be to underestimate just how dangerous entertainments like it can be . 
"it 's one of those baseball pictures where the hero is stoic , the wife is patient , the kids are as cute as all get-out and the odds against success are long enough to intimidate , but short enough to make a dream seem possible . "
"with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge . "
"very special effects , brilliantly bold colors and heightened reality ca n't hide the giant achilles ' heel in `` stuart little 2 `` : there 's just no story , folks . "
it seems like i have been waiting my whole life for this movie and now i ca n't wait for the sequel . 
the terrific and bewilderingly underrated campbell scott gives a star performance that is nothing short of mesmerizing . 
a giggle-inducing comedy with snappy dialogue and winning performances by an unlikely team of oscar-winners : susan sarandon and goldie hawn . 
a movie that successfully crushes a best selling novel into a timeframe that mandates that you avoid the godzilla sized soda . 
lovely and poignant . 
"in the end , the movie collapses on its shaky foundation despite the best efforts of director joe carnahan . "
binoche makes it interesting trying to find out . 
"the inspirational screenplay by mike rich covers a lot of ground , perhaps too much , but ties things together , neatly , by the end . "
griffiths proves she 's that rare luminary who continually raises the standard of her profession . 
"dull , lifeless , and amateurishly assembled . "
"martin and barbara are complex characters -- sometimes tender , sometimes angry -- and the delicate performances by sven wollter and viveka seldahl make their hopes and frustrations vivid . "
this is so bad . 
"if the first men in black was money , the second is small change . "
"still , as a visual treat , the film is almost unsurpassed . "
its well of thorn and vinegar ( and simple humanity ) has long been plundered by similar works featuring the insight and punch this picture so conspicuously lacks . 
"it 's a scattershot affair , but when it hits its mark it 's brilliant . "
"manages to transcend the sex , drugs and show-tunes plot into something far richer . "
"it haunts , horrifies , startles and fascinates ; it is impossible to look away . "
"maud and roland 's search for an unknowable past makes for a haunting literary detective story , but labute pulls off a neater trick in possession : he makes language sexy . "
"there is n't nearly enough fun here , despite the presence of some appealing ingredients . "
"we root for ( clara and paul ) , even like them , though perhaps it 's an emotion closer to pity . "
it 's made with deftly unsettling genre flair . 
rarely has leukemia looked so shimmering and benign . 
the primitive force of this film seems to bubble up from the vast collective memory of the combatants . 
but what are adults doing in the theater at all ? 
"a tender , witty , captivating film about friendship , love , memory , trust and loyalty . "
"wince-inducing dialogue , thrift-shop costumes , prosthetic makeup by silly putty and kmart blue-light-special effects all conspire to test trekkie loyalty . "
to say this was done better in wilder 's some like it hot is like saying the sun rises in the east . 
"trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive . "
the film makes a fatal mistake : it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life . 
"all-in-all , the film is an enjoyable and frankly told tale of a people who live among us , but not necessarily with us . "
it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong . 
intriguing documentary which is emotionally diluted by focusing on the story 's least interesting subject . 
trademark american triteness and simplicity are tossed out the window with the intelligent french drama that deftly explores the difficult relationship between a father and son . 
nothing is sacred in this gut-buster . 
"it will grip even viewers who are n't interested in rap , as it cuts to the heart of american society in an unnerving way . "
... a magnificent drama well worth tracking down . 
a nightmare date with a half-formed wit done a great disservice by a lack of critical distance and a sad trust in liberal arts college bumper sticker platitudes . 
"escaping the studio , piccoli is warmly affecting and so is this adroitly minimalist movie . "
may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen . 
"pumpkin means to be an outrageous dark satire on fraternity life , but its ambitions far exceed the abilities of writer adam larson broder and his co-director , tony r. abrams , in their feature debut . "
"the reality of the new live-action pinocchio he directed , cowrote and starred in borders on the grotesque . "
